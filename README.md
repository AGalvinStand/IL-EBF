## Goal

Create a simulator that show

## Proposed options

We can use this as a tool to simulate options being proposed by PRP and policy groups along with our own ideas. In fact, I think after creating this simulator we draft up a white paper and roll it out publicly (i.e. a press release, etc.).

I think we split the simulator's policy 'levers', so to speak, into three buckets: 

1. **Changes to the additional investments piece of the formula**, which will include adding additional weights<sup>1</sup> for:
    - Concentrated poverty weights;
    - Race.
2. **Changes to the Minimum Funding Level (MFL)**.<sup>2   
3. **Changes to the local capacity target**, namely an option to see how state funding changes if poorer discricts could free up their property levy for capital projects and services.

We will study the effects of these policy changes on 1) the quantitative relationship between school funding (local and state) and race, poverty, income, and  property wealth (i.e. <font color = purple>scatter plots); 2) the spatial relationship between school funding and race, etc. (e.g. an map); 3) 

#### Footnotes:
1) I propose we keep it at two additional weights to keep things simple, though I'm open to discuss this.
2) The MFL is a target (not a mandate) for the state to increase educational funding by at least $350 million each year. With the exception of 2020, State Legislators have done this. See section (g)(9) of the EBF legislation ![public act 100-0465](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/100/PDF/100-0465.pdf).  However, there are two issues. First, $50 million of the $350 million is for property tax relief. In other words, it doesn't increase funding it reimburses districts. This is why I proposed the third option, which would increase funding on net. Second, legislators, for lack of backbone, care, or wit -- probably all three -- have interpreted this as this as a 'ceiling rather than a floor', in the words of a Professional Review Panel member. Hence, I added option #2 as a way of exploring the effects of raising the 'ceiling'.
