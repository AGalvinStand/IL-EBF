## Server Outline
# Load in Illinois EBF data
# Define server logic 
# State formula current + dynamic calculations
# Create app data â€“ code for base, weights, and direct funding 
# Create dynamic formula code 
# Calculate new funding amounts for poverty concentration weights 
# Calculate new funding amounts for increasing MFL 
# Define outputs to show in UI
# Poverty concentration weights increase to funding	# Change in MFL 
#
# This is the server logic of a Shiny web application. You can run the
# application by clicking 'Run App' above.
